## Setup

For using the widget, you need to create a new "Custom Widget", on the bottom of the "Stream Labels" category.

After that, click the "Open Editor" button and paste the files' content in each tab:
- CSS: `widget.css`
- JS: `widget.js`
- Fields: `widget.json`

When done, you'll have to create a new [Twitch Application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and paste both Client ID & Client Secret to the widget settings.
